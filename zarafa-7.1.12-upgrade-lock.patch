Patch by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org> for Zarafa 7.1.12 which backports the fix for
CVE-2015-3436. Guido GÃ¼nther detected and reported that replacing "/tmp/zarafa-upgrade-lock" by
a symlink makes the zarafa-server process following that symlink and thus allows to overwrite
arbitrary files in the filesystem (assuming zarafa-server runs as root which is not the case by
default at Fedora, but it is the upstream default). One just needs write permissions in /tmp and
wait until the zarafa-server is restarted. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1222151
contains further information. The difference between this backport and the original diff is that
the log levels were reworked from Zarafa 7.1.x to 7.2.x (which this backport takes care of).
